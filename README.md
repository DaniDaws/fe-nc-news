# General Information and Overview

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. It allows users to read articles divided into topics, upvote or downvote articles, and add comments about the articles. The goal of this project is to create a dynamic and interactive platform using React, and to consolidate an understanding of making a C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application from a front end perspective. The app provides a seamless user experience with features such as topic-based filtering, sorting articles by different criteria, and managing user comments.
